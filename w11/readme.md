# Dev_1
## What is my dev_1?
- I am going to keep the same concept that I was using for my dev_0, but I am going to make it a little more complex.
- I am making a inventory tracker for a small business.
- I am going to add user inputs to take in the product name, quantity and the date that it is being entered into the system.
- I am also going to make the inventory items removable from the list by product name, quantity and the date that it is being shipped.
- I am also going to try to make the inventory items editable by product name and quantity.
- The inventory items will be stored in local storage and will be displayed on the page.
- I also want to make some sort of field that show the person who is entering the data into the system.
- I am going to try to implement moment.js to show the date and time that the data is being entered into the system.
